# recap

This repo hosts a collection of tools to source and analyze work stats to generate recaps.

The aim is to be more dazzling by the year.

Note:
* PowerShell version used at the time - v7.2
* PowerShell scripts depend on [PowerShellForGitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShellForGitHub)
* GitHub Issue/PR level source data come from [@eqworks/updates](https://github.com/EQWorks/updates), relying on its already parsed structure and injected NLP labels
* Some parts of the analysis Notebooks (`.ipynb`) are intentionally trimmed to protect sensitive stats
